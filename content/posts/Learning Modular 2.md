- I can manage content using established workflows. I was able to follow the instructions that you had put out on canvas and complete setting up the Hugo website with little complications.
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. We have not done anything related to this.
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. I was able to figure out the problems that I had setting the Hugo website up by my self by through critical thinking and using W3schools to figure out what I was doing wrong.
